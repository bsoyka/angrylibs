Usage
=====

Once installed, you can use the ``angrylibs`` command.

.. hint::
   You can also use the ``libs`` command for short!

To get started, just run the command by itself. You'll need to be connected to the Internet the first time you run the program.

.. highlight:: console

::

    $ angrylibs

The program will guide you through what you need to know the first time around, but if you'd ever like to see the instructions again, just reset your settings.

Resetting the Program
---------------------

Just run the program with the ``--reset-settings`` flag to reset your Angry Libs settings.

::

    $ angrylibs --reset
    Are you sure you want to reset all Angry Libs settings [y/n] (n)? y
    Success!

Now, just run the program again without the flag and it'll be just like new.
