One __adjective__ __noun__, my __relative__ told us we were __verb_ing__ for a hike! We were all very __adjective__ and __adjective__ about this idea.

We put on our __plural_noun__, filled our __noun__ __plural_noun__, and grabbed the __noun__. We were __adjective__ to go!

It took a whole __number__ __plural_noun__ to get to the __noun__, but it was worth it, although the __noun__ was pretty __adjective__.

On the trail, we saw __adjective__ __plural_noun__, __noun_AN__, and __number__ __plural_noun__!

In the end, it was __adverb_AN__ __adjective__ __noun__. Next time, I'll bring along my __relative__!
