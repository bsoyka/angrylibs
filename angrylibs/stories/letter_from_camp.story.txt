Dear __relative__,

I am having __adjective_AN time at camp. The counselour is __adjective__ and the food is __adjective__. I met __person_in_room/1__ and we became __adjective__ friends. Unfortunately, __person_in_room/1__ is __adjective__ and I __verb_ed__ my __body_part__ so we couldn't go __verb_ing__ like everybody else. I need more __plural_noun__ and __noun_AN__ sharpener, so please __adverb__ __verb__ more when you __verb__

Your __relative__,
__person_in_room__
