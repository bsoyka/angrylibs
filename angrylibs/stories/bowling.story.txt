Almost every community in America now has a bowling __noun__ because bowling has become very __adjective_ with young __plural_noun__. Most of them have become very __adjective__ at the game.

The main object of the game is to roll a heavy bowling __noun__ down the alley and knock down the __number__ pins at the other end.

If you knock them down in one roll, it's called __silly_word_AN__. If it takes two rolls, it's called __silly_word_AN__.

Many alleys have automatic __noun__ setters. Others hire __plural_noun__ who set the pins by __noun__.

The most important thing to remember when bowling is to make sure you have a good grip on the __noun__ or you're liable to drop it on your __body_part__!
