Let's make a snowman! First we need to have a really __adjective__ snowstorm on __adverb_AN__ __adjective__ day. Watching all that __adjective__ snow fall makes me __verb__ out of __emotion__!

Now that there's plenty of __noun__, we can get started! We'll start out by making __adjective_AN__ __noun/1__ and __verb_ing__ it in the snow.

Once the __noun/1__ is __adjective__ and __adjective__, we'll make another one! Once we've __verb_ed__ __number__ __plural_noun__, we're almost done!

To finish off our snowman, we just need to add __number__ __plural_noun__, __noun_AN__, and __noun_AN__.
